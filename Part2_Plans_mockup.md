The Project spans into second phase, which we now must plan to implement the following;

not necessarily in order:
a) Some kind of actual log-in method
b) a 'Shipping cart'.
c) a 'Milage' points (undecided?)
d) Check-out system using Card transaction

e) Upgrade the email-contactus system into something else ( current Sendgrid is valid only until Nov( Free Trial))




BrainStorming;

[a,b,c,d] Above requires that the system 'remembers' the user 
whether in an 'instance' or else.

[a]: needs some kind of 'security' method for user protection
        - User unique code...? Identification numbers...? (backend)

    : needs some kind of 'database' for "validation" of a 'password'
        - 
        
    : needs to "retain" the user's selection in a shipping cart and/or milage points.
    : 

[b,c] : requires database for user selection and accumulating milage points.

[d]
